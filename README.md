# SLR mobile Android app
This repository is the automatic Sign Language Recognition application used in the master thesis of Helene Amlie and Ingrid Marie WÃ¸lneberg.
The application has functionality for choosing a video on the mobile phone to be classified or recording a new video that will be classified after ending the recording.
After classification, the top-5 predictions with scores, inference time, and processing time are displayed.

The code is inspired by and has used certain methods from two tutorials found online:
* A tutorial on using Camera X in Android applications: https://github.com/philipplackner/CameraXGuide/tree/recording-videos
* A tutorial on using MoViNet stream version in an Android application for action recognition: https://github.com/tensorflow/examples/tree/master/lite/examples/video_classification/android

### Branches in use
* main: for running MoViNet models in TensorFlow Lite format
  * movinetA- branches are the same as the main branch but use other versions of MoViNet
* onnx: for running I3D in Onnx format.
